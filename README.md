# Pressbreak
The Wordpress deployment platform

## Mission Statement
The goal of Pressbreak is to provide an easy to use automated deployment platform for Wordpress developers while keeping the number of dependancies to a minimum.

## Target Audience
Pressbreak is intended for Wordpress developers who either work on a development copy of their sites locally or have their own, seperate hosting from production.
